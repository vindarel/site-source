  (:h1 "Tabs Suck.")
  (:p "As a paradigm, tabs work for well for inexperienced users, they
provide a simple visual representation that's easy to follow.
Unfortunately that's where the benefits of tabs end. Users often spend
several frustrating minutes combing through tabs to find what they are
looking for. To get beyond this point, and do some real work, you need
something more powerful.")

  (:h1 "What is a Powerful Tool?")
  (:p "Before we discuss what that tool is, let's define what makes a tool
more powerful in this context:")
  (:ul
   (:li (:b "Scale: ") "It should not be slower to use with more tabs ")
   (:li (:b "Access time: ") "The time to access a tab should be quick")
   (:li (:b "Do what I mean: ") "It should be smart, it should know what I
want."))
  (:h1 "Next: Instant Switch Tabs")
  (:p "Instead of using a tab bar, next uses a smart list of tabs.
What does this mean? This means switching to any tab is as easy as
typing any part of the title.")
  (:p "No matter how many tabs you open, jumping to any of them takes
the exact same amount of time- none at all. No more tab hunting, no
more scaling pains-use a smart browser that helps you get it done."))
